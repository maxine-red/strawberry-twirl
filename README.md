# Strawberry Twirl

## About the modpack

Strawberry Twirl aims to be a fun vanilla++ pack. The focus is on fun mechanics, magic and creativity.
Of course, it also has automation, though there aren't going to be any quests. The experience is supposed to be more about making things pretty, rather than efficient.
See it more leaning towards vanilla Minecraft, in that way. Cross compapbility
is added, to allow automation of tasks, but it is very much **not** the focus of
this pack.

Mods are also left alone, so the only progression is within mods. You are also
not forced to progress into one mod or another. Though, some things require
getting into multiple mods. Then it's kept to entry level (for the other mod)
though.

## Supported MC versions (Java)

- 1.16.5
